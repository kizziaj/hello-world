# hello-world
Tutorial repository for Git

The tutorial says to write a bit about myself but I just had to do this for my client web class so I don't really feel like doing it here much. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. I spent my first few years of my life moving up and down the east coast. I've had 1 dog, several cats, 4 birds, and half a dozen fish as pets. Originally I was a physics major, but NC State was a terrible school for me and I eventually changed over to computer science.
